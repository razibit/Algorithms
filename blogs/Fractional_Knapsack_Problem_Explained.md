The **fractional knapsack problem** is a classic problem in computer science, particularly in the field of greedy algorithms and optimization. It’s a variant of the 0/1 knapsack problem but allows you to take fractions of items rather than just whole items. Here’s an in-depth look:

### Problem Statement:
You are given:
- A knapsack with a weight capacity $ W $.
- $ n $ items, each with a weight $ w_i $ and a value $ v_i $.

The goal is to maximize the total value in the knapsack while staying within the weight limit $ W $. In the fractional knapsack problem, you can take a fraction of an item if it doesn’t fit entirely in the knapsack.

### Key Difference: 
Unlike the **0/1 knapsack problem** where you must either take an entire item or leave it, in the **fractional knapsack problem**, you can break an item and take only part of it.

### Approach:
The **greedy algorithm** is used to solve the fractional knapsack problem efficiently.

### Steps in the Greedy Approach:
1. **Calculate the value-to-weight ratio** for each item:
   $
   \text{ratio}_i = \frac{v_i}{w_i}
   $
   This ratio represents how much value you get for each unit of weight of an item.
   
2. **Sort the items by their value-to-weight ratio** in decreasing order.

3. **Fill the knapsack**:
   - Start adding items to the knapsack, beginning with the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio.
   - If an item fits entirely in the knapsack, add it.
   - If an item does not fit, take the fraction of the item that fits.

4. **Stop when the knapsack is full** or when you’ve processed all items.

### Algorithm:

```python
def fractional_knapsack(values, weights, capacity):
    # Calculate value to weight ratio and sort by this ratio
    ratio = [(v / w, w, v) for v, w in zip(values, weights)]
    ratio.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])

    total_value = 0  # Total value of items in the knapsack
    for r, w, v in ratio:
        if capacity > 0:
            if w <= capacity:
                # Take the entire item
                total_value += v
                capacity -= w
            else:
                # Take the fraction of the item
                total_value += r * capacity
                break  # Knapsack is full

    return total_value
```
### Example:
Consider a knapsack with a capacity of 50 units and the following items:

| Item | Value ($v_i$) | Weight ($w_i$) |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1    | 60              | 10               |
| 2    | 100             | 20               |
| 3    | 120             | 30               |

1. Calculate the value-to-weight ratios:
   $
   \text{ratio}_1 = \frac{60}{10} = 6, \quad \text{ratio}_2 = \frac{100}{20} = 5, \quad \text{ratio}_3 = \frac{120}{30} = 4
   $
   
2. Sort by the ratio (already in descending order here).

3. Start filling the knapsack:
   - Add item 1 (10 units) — remaining capacity = 50 - 10 = 40.
   - Add item 2 (20 units) — remaining capacity = 40 - 20 = 20.
   - Add $ \frac{20}{30} $ fraction of item 3 — total weight = 50.

   **Total value**:
   - From item 1: 60
   - From item 2: 100
   - From $ \frac{20}{30} $ of item 3: $ \frac{20}{30} \times 120 = 80 $

   So, the total value in the knapsack is $ 60 + 100 + 80 = 240 $.

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting** the items by value-to-weight ratio takes $ O(n \log n) $, where $ n $ is the number of items.
- **Filling the knapsack** involves iterating over the items, which takes $ O(n) $.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is $ O(n \log n) $.

### Greedy Choice Property:
The fractional knapsack problem exhibits the **greedy choice property**, meaning that taking the locally optimal choice (item with the highest value-to-weight ratio) at each step results in a globally optimal solution.

### Applications:
- Resource allocation where partial assignment is allowed (e.g., filling containers with goods that can be divided into smaller parts).
- Situations where you need to maximize profit given limited capacity, such as selecting stocks to invest in a limited portfolio.

This makes the fractional knapsack problem a popular and essential topic in algorithm design and analysis.
