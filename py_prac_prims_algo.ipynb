    "Let’s dive into why we use `map` and why the alternative you proposed won’t work as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use `map`?**\n",
    "The `map` function applies a specified function to each item in an iterable (like a list or a string). In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "row = list(map(int, input().split()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what happens step by step:\n",
    "1. **`input()`**: Reads a single line of user input as a string.\n",
    "   - Example: If the user enters `1 2 3`, the result is the string `\"1 2 3\"`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`.split()`**: Splits the string into a list of substrings, based on spaces by default.\n",
    "   - For `\"1 2 3\"`, the result is the list `[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`map(int, ...)`:** Converts each element in the list from a string to an integer.\n",
    "   - `[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`list(...)`:** Wraps the result of `map` into a list.\n",
    "   - Finally, `row` is `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Does `map` Do?**\n",
    "`map(function, iterable)` applies the given `function` to every element in the `iterable`. It’s concise and efficient for operations like type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case:\n",
    "- `function`: `int` (to convert strings to integers).\n",
    "- `iterable`: The list of substrings returned by `.split()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Can't We Use `row = list(int(input().split()))`?**\n",
    "This alternative would raise an error because of how `list(int(...))` is interpreted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`input().split()`**: Splits the string into a list of substrings, e.g., `[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]`.\n",
    "2. **`int(...)`**: Expects a single string (like `\"1\"`) to convert into an integer, but here it gets the entire list `[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]`.\n",
    "3. **Error Raised:** Python throws a `TypeError` because you can’t directly pass a list to `int()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **If You Don't Use `map`, How Would You Do It?**\n",
    "You could achieve the same result using a list comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "row = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This does the same thing:\n",
    "1. **`input().split()`**: Splits the input into a list of substrings.\n",
    "2. **`int(x)` in list comprehension**: Converts each substring `x` to an integer.\n",
    "3. **`[ ... ]`**: Collects all the converted integers into a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is more explicit and beginner-friendly but slightly less concise than `map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "- `map` is used to efficiently apply `int` to every element of the list returned by `.split()`.\n",
    "- `row = list(int(input().split()))` doesn’t work because `int` cannot process a list directly.\n",
    "- As an alternative, you can use a list comprehension: `[int(x) for x in input().split()]`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The `map()` function in Python doesn't return a regular list. Instead, it returns a special object called a **`map` object**, which is an **iterator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterator:** A sequence object that can be iterated (looped) over to retrieve values one at a time. It doesn’t store all the values in memory at once, which makes it memory-efficient, especially for large datasets.\n",

    "2. **Access Values Directly:** Unlike lists, you cannot directly index or slice a `map` object (e.g., `map_obj[0]` is invalid).\n",
    "3. **Print Readable Results:** If you print a `map` object directly, you’ll get something like `<map object at 0x000001234567>` instead of the actual values.\n",

    "The line `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` is a common construct in Python programs. It serves a specific purpose related to how Python executes code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Python Script Execution**\n",
    "When you run a Python file (script), the interpreter executes the code from top to bottom. Along with this execution, Python sets a special built-in variable called `__name__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How `__name__` is Set:**\n",
    "- If the Python file is being run **directly** as a script (e.g., `python my_script.py`), the `__name__` variable is set to `\"__main__\"`.\n",
    "- If the file is **imported** as a module into another Python file, the `__name__` variable is set to the **name of the file/module** (e.g., `\"my_script\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Purpose of `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**\n",
    "This construct is used to control the execution of code depending on whether the file is run as a script or imported as a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Use This Check?**\n",
    "1. **To Prevent Unintended Execution:**\n",
    "   - Without this check, the code in a script would execute **even when the file is imported** into another script/module. This might not be desirable.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # script1.py\n",
    "     print(\"This is script1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     # script2.py\n",
    "     import script1\n",
    "     print(\"This is script2\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Running `script2.py` would print:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This is script1\n",
    "     This is script2\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulating the Script's Functionality:**\n",
    "   - Placing code inside `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` ensures that it **only runs when the script is executed directly**, not when it's imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enable Modular Code:**\n",
    "   - You can write reusable functions and classes in a file and import them into other files without worrying about the script executing unintended parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. How It Works in Our Code**\n",
    "In our implementation of Prim's Algorithm:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    graph = input_graph()  # Get the graph from the user\n",
    "    print(\"\\nRunning Prim's Algorithm:\")\n",
    "    prims_algorithm(graph)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This block ensures that the functions `input_graph()` and `prims_algorithm(graph)` are **only called when the script is executed directly**.\n",
    "- If someone imports this script into another Python file, only the functions (`input_graph`, `prims_algorithm`) will be available for use, but the main code block won’t execute automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Advantages**\n",
    "- **Reusability:** You can reuse the functions in other projects by importing the script.\n",
    "- **Control:** It keeps the script's \"testing\" or \"execution\" logic separate from its reusable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Example**\n",
    "#### File: `prim_example.py`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello from prim_example!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"This script is being run directly.\")\n",
    "    hello()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File: `main_script.py`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import prim_example\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"This is the main script.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running `python prim_example.py` will output:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This script is being run directly.\n",
    "  Hello from prim_example!\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running `python main_script.py` will output:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This is the main script.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the message `\"This script is being run directly.\"` is **not displayed** when `prim_example` is imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct allows you to:\n",
    "1. Separate the script's executable code from its reusable components.\n",
    "2. Prevent code execution when the script is imported as a module.\n",
    "3. Control when and how specific parts of your script are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a best practice in Python programming, especially for larger and modular codebases."
